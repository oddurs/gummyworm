We're excited to announce **gummyworm 2.2.0**, packed with quality-of-life improvements that make working with ASCII art even more enjoyable.

## Configuration File Support

Tired of typing the same options over and over? Now you can set your defaults in a configuration file:

```bash
# ~/.gummywormrc
width=80
color=true
palette=blocks
background=#1a1b26
```

gummyworm looks for config files in this order:
1. `./.gummywormrc` (project-specific)
2. `~/.gummywormrc` (user defaults)
3. `~/.config/gummyworm/config` (XDG-compliant)

CLI arguments always override config file settings, so you have full flexibility.

## Shell Completions

Tab completion is now available for **bash** and **zsh**! Get suggestions for:

- All CLI options and flags
- Built-in palette names
- Output format types
- Image files in the current directory

If you installed via Homebrew, completions are set up automatically. Otherwise, source the completion script for your shell:

```bash
# Bash
source /path/to/gummyworm/completions/gummyworm.bash

# Zsh
source /path/to/gummyworm/completions/gummyworm.zsh
```

## What's Next?

This release focuses on developer experience, but we have more exciting features planned. Stay tuned for updates!
